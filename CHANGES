=head1 CHANGES (Apache::VMonitor)

=head1 ver 0.5 - Sat Dec 16 20:06:14 CET 2000

* now mod_perl processes report can be sorted by any of the columns in
  the report (new variable: SORT_BY)

* Documented the required ExtendedStatus to be On in httpd.conf

* Removed the ifconfig(1) emulation section which actually has never
  properly worked, because of the broken underlying implementation in
  libgtop C library.

* On the front page added the count of served requests by child.

* the count of mod_perl procs now starts from 1 (and not 0) (Bill
  Marrs)

* removed the presentation of the real memory used for other
  non-modperl processes since it didn't handle correctly threaded
  processes like mysql. Currently I don't see how can get to this info
  from libgtop. Suggestions are welcome.

* corrected a bug where user dynamic settings (like refresh rate) were
  affecting global variables, thus making it hard for two admins to
  monitor the same site. Now dynamic setting (triggered by clicks on
  the interface) don't affect the preset values.

* changed the number formats in the system section to always use b/K/M
  if applicable (using Apache::Util::size_string)

* correctly reporting the number of processes (some were counted even
  when they were in the process of death)

* Added to top() section: date/time, uptime, average load, num of
  procs (linux only).

  Per process removed the memory segment info (wasn't interested),
  added instead a number of bytes transferred and a number of requests
  processed, a current status of each process, last request and the
  client's IP.

* Added a dynamic configuration: dynamically turn on and off all the
  sections and enter a verbose mode that explains each section and the
  used abreviations. and of course the explanations themselves :)

  but wasn't yet replaced. (it doesn't display those anymore :)
